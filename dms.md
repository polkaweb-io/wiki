### Distribution Management System (DMS) <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Distribution Management System (DMS) is an intelligent blockchain based distribution
network solution that proactively reduces peak demand, optimizes network assets, while
assisting distribution networks deliver resources more efficiently, reliably, securely, and
anonymously.

Distribution Management System integrates into dCLOUD system and ‘mines’ the data layer
such that information pertinent to your tasks is quickly calculated and summarized in order
to make informed operating and business decisions.

One of the major reasons for software deployment failure is that the target device does not
meet the prerequisites. It can take up a lot of time to figure out the exact issue and then
troubleshoot it accordingly. dCLOUDS pre deployment activities let you perform condition
checks and apply configurations before delivery, to ensure that the target device meets all
the requirements and has all the configurations set up
