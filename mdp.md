### Malware Defence Protocol (MDP) <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

What matters to a malware author is to keep his creation invisible. At first, when a malware
comes in contact with different protection and analysis engines, such as a sandbox and an
anti-virus, it needs to be kept hidden, quiet. In a second moment, when the malware has
already infected a device, it also needs to be kept in secret, evading any tool that can locate
it.
That’s what is generally called evasion techniques.
To carry out a foolproof defense we rely on the following techniques:

1. Environmental awareness. It’s the use of different methods to identify a system’s configuration.


2. User interaction. It’s a set of techniques for detecting user actions, such as moving the mouse and clicking.


3. Domain and IP anonymity. It’s the method of keeping the IP anonymous in order to make communication unidentifiable by invaders.


4. Stegosploit. This technique consists of hiding malicious code or malware within images.


5. Timing-based. It’s a method based on periods of time, when a malware takes action at certain times and lies dormant on others.


6. Code obfuscation. It’s a set of coding changes to hide malicious code.


7. Code encryption. It’s the use of encryption to hide malicious code.


8. Code compression. This technique consists of compressing files to hide malicious code.
