# What are dClouds:

 <p>
          Now here is some good news. Imagine a scenario where multiple servers
          take part in single web communication and at the same time apt to
          perform anything that a high end server can do !
        </p>
        <p>
          This will only be possible when we break all the communication in
          thousands and lacs of ‘dCLOUDS (Decentralized Clouds)’ which take
          control of everything from core server technologies to users activated
          functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These dCLOUDS are nothing but discrete server blocks on top of our
          industrious web architecture that perform peer to peer smart
          contracting on programmatic logics thereby eliminating the need of one
          large central command and control server to process web requests,
          resource allocation, point to point communication and the delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primarily to secure & anonymize the interaction, Polkaweb is valuable
          also for its capabilities which allow users to perform their functions
          with least hardware resources while benefiting from the Decentralized
          Web Architecture offered in the form of dCLOUDS.
        </p>
        <p>
          These dCLOUDS are blockchain based anonymous and distributed frames of
          technology which gain all of its momentum through the User activated
          functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once activated, dCLOUDS at first analyses the resource requirement to
          remotely execute the function and then to deploy the architecture by
          matching the web requests for targeted delivery of web resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, no instance of threats such as Data loss of leakage, Data
          Privacy, Accidental exposure of credentials or DDoS come into
          existence.

<b>The framework professionally uses below mentioned technologies being core to the dCLOUDS:</b>

### [Software-defined network](sdn.md "Software-defined network | polkaweb.io") <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<b>Software-defined network</b> (SDN) architecture (or SDN architecture) defines how a
networking and computing system can be built using a combination of open, softwarebased technologies and commodity networking hardware

### [Distribution Management System](dms.md "Distribution Management System | polkaweb.io") <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<b>Distribution Management System</b> (DMS) is a collection of applications designed to monitor
& control the entire distribution network efficiently and reliably. It acts as a decision
support system to assist the control room and field operating personnel with the
monitoring and control of the resource distribution system

###  [Malware Defence Protocol](mdp.md "Malware Defence Protocol | polkaweb.io") <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<b>Malware Defence Protocol</b> (MDP) Polkaweb establishes a baseline in your network and
helps to categorize events into two main categories; human activity versus machine activity.
dCLOUDS and Protocol Ecosystem help to anonymize the interaction & delivery thereby
making the data transaction immune to malwares

### [Integrated Execution Mechanism](iem.md "Integrated Execution Mechanism | polkaweb.io") <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<b>Integrated Execution Mechanism</b> (IEM) The framework allows users to point all the
requests towards an anonymous dCLOUD which on top of a random accession program
attaches the remotely available web resources to users hardwares thereby performs the
tasks on mix & match basis.

### [Performance Identification Application](pia.md "erformance Identification Application | polkaweb.io") <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<b>Performance Identification Application</b> (PIA) The logically operated application finds the
best way programmatically to protect the web communication and connects 4 to 10
dCLOUD nodes in order to anonymize the resource utilization, communication & delivery.

### Time specific task unloading <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<b>Time specific task unloading</b> (TSTU) The ecosystem creates an instantaneous program
every time when a user so activates it which sets a turnaround time frame for all the tasks
required to be performed for its successful completion. This ensures anything beyond the
set time frame gets a null space thereby eliminating the threat of manual interference by
intruders & attackers
