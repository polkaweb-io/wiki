# What would it solve?

Information Technology persistently making it easier to communicate & deliver the web
resources beyond boundaries, however all such ease came with a price.
Take Cyber-attacks for instance. Cybercrime is a business, and cybercriminals select their
targets based upon the expected profitability of their attacks. Cloud-based infrastructure is
directly accessible from the public Internet, is often improperly secured, and contains a
great deal of sensitive and valuable data. Additionally, the cloud is used by many different
companies, meaning that a successful attack can likely be repeated many times with a high
probability of success. As a result, organizations’ cloud deployments are a common target
of cyberattacks.

Breakthrough Technologies, apart from the goodness of its pioneers, gives rise also to a
class of people intruding and attacking the core architecture which serves as a nodal point
for web interaction & delivery. Here we commonly call it A ‘Server’.

A server, more commonly ‘CLOUD SERVER’ which is accessible remotely by its users is a
remote computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other
computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share
resources with client machines, they are considered servers. There are many types of
servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.

Now to secure it well from common Internet threats such as DDoS, Spyware, Key Loggers,
Trojan, Viruses and Pharming it is now imperative to protect it from the aforesaid
challenges which is a long drawn problem among the Internet fraternity and the
professionals are restlessly working to make it as secure as possible by coming out with
innovative programs & technologies to counter those threats as and when they appears.
Importantly, all such labour is specifically pointed to develop and integrate programmable
security layers thereby the Servers are made immune to the web threats, unfortunately
with imperfections.
