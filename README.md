Polkaweb is an open & decentralized on-chain web framework proficient enough to outrightly secure and deliver peer to peer network distributable computer programs & solutions. With the application of blockchain based technologies it is safer & easier now than it ever has been to take advantage of modern Web Infrastructure to remotely assess, develop, deliver & distribute web based solutions of many sorts, be it software programs, web applications or digital services and at the same time to secure the interaction among users with a benchmark standard blockchain controlled person to person reliant security layers.

This innovative platform will ease the users to singularly focus on their primary functions leaving everything else from security to confidentiality on Polkaweb for its well defined architecture will effectively enforce on-chain contracts and outperform security threats due to its decentralized & on-chain nature of P2P contracting.
